## About

This is a sample project that takes a survey and posts it to an API. It can also retrieve the submissions from the server and perform some calculations.

## Configuration

Remember to run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Getting started

1. Run `ng serve --open --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
` to start the server

The proxy.conf.json is important because it forwards the HTTP requests to the API when needed.
